# Simple Linear Classification
The data set weâ€™ll be using is the Iris Flower Dataset which was first introduced in 1936 by the famous statistician Ronald Fisher and consists of 50 observations from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals.
